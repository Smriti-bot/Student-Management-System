        ## 🛢 MySQL Database Setup

### 1️⃣ Create the database

-- db/schema.sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS sms_db;
USE sms_db;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  last_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(150) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  course VARCHAR(100),
  grade VARCHAR(5),
  enrollment_date DATE
);

-- sample data
INSERT INTO students (first_name,last_name,email,course,grade,enrollment_date)
VALUES
  ('Aman','Verma','aman.v@example.com','Computer Science','A','2024-08-01'),
  ('Sana','Gupta','sana.g@example.com','Mechanical','B','2023-07-15');
USE sms_db;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students;
SELECT * FROM students LIMIT 10;
